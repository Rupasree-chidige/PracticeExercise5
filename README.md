1. Write a Java program to update specific array element by given element and empty the array list.
Input: [Apple, Grape, Melon, Berry]
Output: [Kiwi, Grape, Mango, Berry]
Array list after removing all elements []

2. Write a program to find the number of counts in the following String. Store the output in
Map<String,Integer> as key value pair.
Input : String str = “one one -one___two,,three,one @three*one?two”;
Output : {"one":5 , "two":2, "three" :2}

3. Write a program where an array of strings is input and output is a Map<String,boolean> where
each different string is a key and its value is true if that string appears 2 or more times in the array
Input : String arr[] = {“a”,”b”,”c”,”d”,”a”,”c”,”c”}
Output - {“a” : true,”b” :false ,”c” :true,”d” : false}

4. Create a Student class that represents the following information of a student: id, name, and age
all the member variables should be private .
a. Implement `getter and setter` .
b. Create a `StudentSorter` class that implements `Comparator interface` .
c. Write a class `Maintest` create Student class object(minimum 5)
d. Add these student object into a List of type Student .
e. Sort the list based on their age in decreasing order, for student having
same age, sort based on their name.
f. For students having same name and age, sort them according to their ID.

5. Write a method that accepts a Map object having two key-value pairs with the keys val1 and val2.
Modify and return the given map as follows:
a. If the key `val1` has a value, set the key `val2` to have that value, and
b. Set the key `val1` to have the value `" "` (empty string).
Example 1:
The map {"val1": "java", "val2": "c++"} should return {"val1": " ", "val2":
"java"}
Example 2:
The map {"val1": "mars", "val2": "saturn"} should return {"val1": " ", "val2":
"mars"}

6. Write a program to implement set interface which sorts the given randomly ordered names in

ascending order. Convert the sorted set in to an array list
Input : Harry Olive Alice Bluto Eugene
Output :
Sorted Set : Alice Bluto Eugene Harry Olive
Array list from Set : Alice Bluto Eugene Harry Olive
